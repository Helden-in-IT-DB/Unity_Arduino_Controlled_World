## Unity_Arduino_Controlled_World

Welcome to my little project I worked on while at Helden in IT. This repository includes the Unity Input System, work on a custom Arduino controller, and Blender work with animation.

# For an explanation about how to set up the new Unity Input System:
 - Go to documentation and select the Unity Input System PowerPoint.

# For an explanation about how to set up a Raspberry Pi Pico controller:
 - Go to documentation and select the 'Basic Raspberry Pi Pico Controller Setup' PowerPoint.

# To open the Unity project:
1. Open Unity Hub and go to the Projects tab.
2. Select the 'Add' button and search your files until you find the 'Unity' folder in your repository.
3. If Unity Hub tells you to install a specific version of Unity, just install it and wait until it's done.
